# Text-Analysis-Project
 
Please read the [instructions](instructions.md).

# 1. Project Overview (~1 paragraph)
I used the data source Newspaper3k to scrape and curate news articles.  
The techniques I used to process or analyze them include using tools in the natural language toolkit as well as the Collections module for more efficient ways of using lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
I simply hoped to create functioning code and I hope to learn more techniques like the nltk; I also hope to be able to practice the techniques I already know and learn to implement them in more efficient ways in terms of formatting and conciseness.

# 2. Implementation (~1-2 paragraphs + screenshots)
Instead, talk about the major components, algorithms, data structures and how they fit together. You should also discuss at least one design decision where you had to choose between multiple alternatives, and explain why you made the choice. Use screenshots to describe how you used ChatGPT to help you or learn new things.



# 3. Results (~2-3 paragraphs + figures/examples)
If you did some text analysis, what interesting things did you find? Graphs or other visualizations may be very useful here for showing your results.
If you created a program that does something interesting (e.g. a Markov text synthesizer), be sure to provide a few interesting examples of the program's output.


# 4 Reflection (~1-2 paragraphs)
From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good testing plan?

From a learning perspective, mention what you learned through this project, how ChatGPT helped you, and how you'll use what you learned going forward. What do you wish you knew beforehand that would have helped you succeed?
